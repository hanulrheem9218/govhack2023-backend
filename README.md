# Green Kiwi Backend Server

This project serves as the backend server for Green Kiwi and is written in Express.js. I was assigned as the backend developer,
and I had the privilege of working alongside **Jun Hyeok**, our senior backend developer, who provided invaluable assistance to the 
team. We were given just two days to develop the backend server during the competition, and although I was new to Express.js, 
with the guidance and support of my senior colleague, I was able to successfully complete the backend server. This experience
taught me that achieving fast production results requires both knowledge and the ability to work effectively as part of a team.
